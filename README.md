# Medicine Management
The objective of the Medicine Management is to develop a functional prototype for a product that helps senior citizens better adhere to their medication regimen. This product consists of an automatic pill dispenser and an easy-to-use GUI with a calendar function for managing medication schedules. This schedule will be able to include both pill and non-pill medications.
